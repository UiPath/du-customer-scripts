Here are located the DataManager scripts. Because the DM backend is written in Python,
the scripts will mostly be written in Python as well to have a way to re-use the code.
Please read the comments as the top of the script you're going to use for better usage instructions.

Scripts for the new version are located in the root folder, and the ones for the legacy version
are in the _legacy_ folder.
